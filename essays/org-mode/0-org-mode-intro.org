Org mode is an Emacs major mode for capturing thoughts and organizing life. It
essentially consists of a markup language and numerous integrations with the Emacs
text editor which gives org mode its super powers.

Org files are plain text files which can be manipulated using any text editor.
And there are packages for /rich/ editing of org files for most of the popular text
editors. But nothing comes close to the power that Emacs ecosystem provides. I wouldn't
shy of recommending Emacs just as an Org mode client if it's not the text editor
of your choice.
