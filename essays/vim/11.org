This is part 11 of a series of tutorial to Vim. You can read [[./10.org][Part 10 here]].

Till now we have seen several ways to navigate within a buffer in Vim. In this part
we'll see how we can move across files, how to jump directly to function or variable
definitions and jumping right in middle of a file at a predefined place.

* ~:e~ on steroids
  You want to open a file, your file is deep down in the folder hierarchy, you don't
  want to type in full path and of course, you want to open it fast. Vim can help
  you with that too.

  Press ~:e **/<file name initials>~ and press ~<TAB>~ to let Vim search for all
  files starting with given initials and prepare a list of choices for you. You
  can cycle through the list using ~<TAB>~ and ~<enter>~ to select a file to edit.

   - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
   - Write programs to work together.
   - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
   #+END_QUOTE
   Installation size of Vim is less than size of an average quality 3 minute MP3.
   Instead of having every feature, it relies on help from external programs. There
   are several language specific plugins which give Vim /IDE like/ features such
   as jumping to function definition, REPL etc. We won't discuss these here but
   one program here which works for all languages: ~ctags~[fn:1].

   ~ctags~ generate a ~tags~ file which has index of names found in source files[fn:4].
   This index is used to jump to function, identifier definition. You can create
   a ~tags~ file by executing ~ctags -R .~[fn:2] from root directory. This will create
   the ~tags~ file in root of the project. You can start Vim without any arguments
   from the root and use ~:e **/file-name~ to open files so that ~tags~ file is
   loaded by Vim[fn:3].

   Once ~tags~ is loaded, jumping around is simple:
   - you can jump to definition of the function name or identifier under cursor
     by pressing ~<ctrl>+]~.
   - or explicitly search for a name by ~:tag <name>~.
   - After jumping to definition, if you search for another name you will build
     a deeper /tag stack/. Vim remembers your history of tag jumps using such tag
     stack.
   - To go back to previous position from where you searched (that is up the tag stack)
     press ~<ctrl>+t~.
   - You can see the stack by executing ~:tags~.
   - And, if there are multiple definition for same name (say because of function
     overloading), Vim jumps to the first option if you press ~<ctrl>+]~, to see
     all the options press ~g~ followed by ~<ctrl>+]~.

[fn:1] Similarly ~ctags~ works with other editors too.
[fn:2] ~-R~ to generate recursively for files, you may also want to add options like ~--exclude~.
[fn:3] This step is necessary to make sure Vim loads the ~tags~ file. But this is not the only way.
[fn:4] ~tags~ is a text file which you easily open and play around with. It contains regex rules which helps in jumping.
