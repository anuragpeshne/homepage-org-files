Recently, I became very interested in measuring the electricity consumption
of electronic devices at my home and, in particular, my computer. Computer power
supplies are typically rated from 400W to 800W. I wanted to see how much power is
actually needed for day to day computing - writing code, browsing internet, playing
games, running ML jobs. And how does it compare with laptop and other mobile devices.

As a kid, I was once told by an engineer that the bulk of energy is consumed by
the monitor, and the desktop itself consumes very little energy. So if I switch off
the monitor, I can play music, download things overnight without wasting too much
energy. This statement stuck with me over time as my bulky CRT monitor was replaced
with sleek LED monitors and a beefy 250W GPU got added to my desktop. It was time
I measure everything and find out if it still makes sense.

  A quick search revealed that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt][Kill A Watt]] meters are one of the most popular ways
  of measuring energy consumption. I wanted to log the consumption so that I can
  analyze the trends over time. That's why I passed these meters on. But these meters
  have an inbuilt screen and do not require mobile or network access so they can
  be a great solution if someone is looking for a quick way to see the consumption.
  On the other end of the spectrum, there are some devices that can be plugged directly
  into the circuit panel of the house and they can be used to analyze consumption
  of all appliances in the house. For my goal of measuring energy consumption of
  computer, this was simply an overkill and would not have provided the fine grained
  monitoring I needed (and I'm a little scared of messing with AC power).

  I finally settled on TP Link Power Strip: [[https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-wi-fi-power-strip-hs300][HS300]]. This /smart/ power strip has
  the usual /smart/ plug features like they can be controlled using a mobile app, but
  it also has enery monitoring. And most importantly there are some awesome projects
  on Github - [[https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa][python-kasa]], [[https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100][pyHS100]] - that have reverse engineered the communication
  protocol and provide a nice interface to talk to them.

  get extracted, stored and visualized.
