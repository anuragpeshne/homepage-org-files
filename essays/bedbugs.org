* Arrival
  It is mid of 2020 and we are living in extraordinary times due to COVID-19. I
  haven't left my apartment except for groceries since early March. And just when one
  might think that nothing more remarkable than a pandemic can happen, sometime during
  end of March I started seeing some red bumps on my toes. Yes, bloody soul sucking,
  hope crushing, the almighty Bed Bugs decided to raid me in the middle of a pandemic!

** Denial
   My first reaction to bites was of denial. There was no way of getting infected
   during a lockdown. I've experienced bed bugs before while I was a grad student
   and I had bought a piece of used furniture. We had to go through three rounds of
   pest control for complete extermination and we were locked out of the apartment
   for the complete day each of the three times. Since this time there was no exchange
   of furniture, luggage or people in the apartment, there was no way for those
   little demons to infect my apartment. So I decided to go Ostrich - stick my head
   in the sand and pretend there is no problem, until...the next morning.

** Detection
   The next morning the number of red bumps on my toes increased and had started
   itching. If this was indeed bed bug infestation, I had to react and do it fast since
   just like an exponential graph things could go out of hand in just few steps.

   The first step was to determine if this was really a bite and not an allergic reaction
   or something else. So that night I slept with body fitted full sleeves clothes
   and with socks on, leaving just my face and hands exposed. The next morning
   unsurprisingly and to my disappointment I saw similar red bumps
   in between my fingers. Although I had a sense of doom that next few weeks of my
   life are not going to be easy, I also had some excitement - I could control
   their behavior! I could change a input in the function to change the output!
   I wondered if I sleep that night exposing both hands and feet, would the insects
   go back biting the feet or their last successful attack ground - hands.

   So these were insect bites and not allergy or rashes. The bites looked similar
   to bed bug bites but to be sure I had to catch one the insect red handed (no
   pun indented ðŸ˜¢), or detect some other signs such as poop stains.

* War
  It's the beginning of April, COVID-19 stay at home order is in effect, I think
  my apartment has got non zero number of bed bug(s), do I invite a stranger at
  home for pest control (and potentially be kicked out of the apartment for 8 hours)
  or live with bed bugs[fn:1] (with no social distancing). I decided to play safe
  with the COVID-19 virus and declared war on the bugs.

  Once you accept the problem it is much easier to fight it. I had a feeling that
  the bugs were not so invincible as I had thought them to be. Maybe I don't need
  to nuke the complete apartment for this early infestation[fn:2].

  I did a quick online search and found that washing clothes with high heat will
  kill the bugs. I dumped everything -pillow covers, bed sheet, blankets- in the
  washing machine and washed on "Hot" water settings. After drying them (again, on
  high heat), I folded them nicely and kept them away because I decided to sleep
  on the couch for few days. My plan was to stay away from the bed, starve the bugs
  to death and then return. This was me being an Ostrich again - run 12 feet away
  and again stick my head in the sand.

  It did not work. The next morning I woke up with itching spots on my chest - sh*t
  just got real.

** Know your Enemy
   The first step was to know everything about Bed bugs. It seems tackling bed bugs
   is no less popular than some sport. There are pages and pages of online articles,
   Youtube videos, blogs and websites. I found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug][Wikipedia]], [[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/bedbugs/faqs.html][CDC FAQs]] and [[https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/how-find-bed-bugs][EPA article]]
   to be most concise.
   Bed bugs are neural network with reward function linked to sucking human blood
   and are equipped with:
   1. COâ‚‚ sensor - to detect Carbon Dioxide released from breathing to locate a human
   2. Pheromone sensor - to follow a path marked by other bugs
   3. and maybe a light sensor - to detect darkness
   I know this is nowhere to complete and mostly an incorrect description of a bed bug.
   But this is good enough for applying our algorithms. Apart from that:
   - They will readily travel 5-20 feet from their shelter to feed - this explains the
     shameful loss of the first battle of the couch.
   - they can survive without food for several months.

** Options
   From all of the articles heat seemed to be the most lethal weapon against the
   bugs. But we need to apply heat directly to the bugs and for that we need to
   find their hiding spot(s). Another interesting solution mentioned in several
   users' post on Reddit, was DE.

*** Diatomaceous Earth
    Diatomaceous Earth or DE is powder made out of a naturally occurring rock.
    Here's a line from Wikipedia that's interesting with respect to bed bugs:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
The fine powder adsorbs lipids from the waxy outer layer of the exoskeletons of
many species of insects; this layer acts as a barrier that resists the loss of water
vapour from the insect's body. Damaging the layer increases the evaporation of water
from their bodies, so that they dehydrate, often fatally.
    #+END_QUOTE

** TODO Air Gap, Firewall
   - horizontal scalling
   - Moved bed away from the wall. Secured all entry/exit points to bed using DE.
   - Binary Search - either bed bugs on the bed or on anything except bed.
   - Slept on bed, got bitten, no big deal. Sleep on the couch for few days.
   - Slept on couch, got bitten again. Bed bugs on bed *and* anything except bed ðŸ˜±

** TODO Inner Ring
   - 1 more chance before calling in "professionals" -- steamer and bed bug cover
   - thought of taking one more chance. Folded the bed sheets inside and created
     "inner ring"

[fn:1] In their defense, bed bugs are not known to carry any pathogens. They might suck your soul, turn you into a sleepless zombie but leave your life pretty safe.
[fn:2] Maybe it's too early to declare victory - the bed bugs can survive up to a year without food.
