* The Garage and MinnowBoard
  One of the nicest perk of working at Microsoft, that not many people know about,
  is access to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Garage][Microsoft Garage]].
  It is a maker space with an immensely helpful community around it. Recently, in
  one of the "spring cleaning" event, where they got rid of old hardware, I got
  my hands on MinnowBoard. It is a x86 based single board computer.

  It has a Gigabit ethernet port and a USB 3.0 port. I had been wanting to play
  with one of the /advanced/ firewalls after reading a couple of articles[fn:1],[fn:2]
  from a long time. This board gave me the perfect opportunity to try out OPNsense,
  an open source Firewall and Routing software.

* Installation
  Creating installation USB drive is pretty straightforward, you can download the latest
  image of OPNsense from the [[https://opnsense.org/download/][official webpage]] and use one of the image flashing utility[fn:3]
  to flash OS images to the USB drive or use the ~dd~ command.

** Booting Issues
   MinnowBoard can boot from various sources including USB drive, PXE server,
   SD card and SATA drive. I got two boards from the event but both of them had distinct
   issues. One of the two could not boot off of a USB nor a SD card, so it would always get
   into the default interactive script mode.

   The other could boot from the USB drive but had damaged SD card slot. So, the
   only option for installation were either a SATA drive or another USB drive.
   Since I did not have a spare SATA SSD at that time, I tried installing OPNsense
   on the board 2 on a USB 3.0 drive. The installation went smoothly, but, when I
   tried to boot it from the installed drive, it turned out that the board can boot
   only from the USB 2.0 port.

** Firmware Upgrade
   I got a little upset and decided to take a break, I had already spent a little too
   much time in trying different combinations of USB drives, installation media and
   configurations.

   The next day, when I had already given up on idea of installing and running OPNsense,
   I decided to upgrade the firmware for no reason, except to see how it's done.
   I had never upgraded firmware on a SBC before so this was a good opportunity to try it out.
   I downloaded the latest firmware release from the [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/minnowboard-maxturbot-uefi-firmware.html][Intel's website]].
   Followed the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCmcRPHwlTo][instructions]]:
   1. copy the ~.efi~ files and the upgrade utility to a USB drive
   2. Determine the current firmware architecture (i32 vs x86)
   3. Use the appropriate utility and select target firmware version
   4. Upgrade!
   Here are the commands I used for reference:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
fs0:/  # this changes the current working directory to the USB drive root
cd firmware
./i32utility ./firmware/x86latestversion.efi # utility arch depends on the arch currently on the system and firmware arch depends on what we want
   #+END_SRC

   I tried this on Board 1 since it couldn't boot from a USB drive. So, it was first
   in line to try out experiments. Fortunately, for me and the board 1, the upgrade was successful
   and the board was not completely bricked. It was able to turn on and was now able
   to boot from a USB!

** Installing OPNsense
   The installation went smoothly after that. I was able to choose SD as the destination
   for installation and the board could smoothly boot from the SD card

** CPU Utilization Issue
   The board was now able to run OPNsense but it was slow. Network requests were taking
   forever to return and in some cases, packets were dropped. After looking at the
   health page, it was clear that this performance issue was due high CPU utilization.
   The CPU was active 97% to 100% all the time. This was the third time I decided
   to give up on using this board for running OPNsense. I thought
   that the board simply did not have enough resources to run OPNsense.

   The next day, I decided to push one last time by trying to get the utilization
   low by maybe deactivating some of the /expensive/ services such as Intrusion Protection.
   After searching the internet, I found out that by disabling the IPv6 DHCP option,
   the utilization drops. And that worked for me! After disabling the DHCPv6
   (Interfaces -> LAN -> IPv6 Configuration Type = None),
   the utilization dropped to 10%. Even after enabling other services, the utilization
   remained below 50%.

I made sure that the USB dongle is capable of 1 GBits/sec running ~iperf~ between
two computers without MinnowBoard-OPNsense.

After introducing MinnowBoard-OPNsense, the max bandwidth I could get was 100 MBits/sec.
** Power Consumption

| Energy Consumed / year | ~ 43.8 kWh          |

* Final Thoughts
  - OPNsense is a secure, FreeBSD based firewall with frequent updates.
  - OPNsense gives more control and insights about home network, along with some useful features:
    - ability to create VLANs
    - network monitoring along with request and bandwidth monitoring
    - firewall and adblock
    - ability to run VPN server - this is helpful while accessing public /open/ WiFi (example at airports/cafes)
      and to access local resource without exposing them to the public internet
  - The max bandwidth, that I could get the MinnowBoard to pump, is ~ 100 MBits / sec.
    This could be a deal breaker for some other users with ISP speed of > 100 MBits/sec.
  - MinnowBoard is a capable and low power consuming way of running OPNsense.
    It can run at ~$5 per year.
